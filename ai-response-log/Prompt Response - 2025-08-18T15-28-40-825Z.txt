Step-by-Step Guide: How to Renew Your Emirates ID

Renewing your Emirates ID is a straightforward process, but it’s important to follow the correct steps and be aware of the required documents and timelines. Here’s a clear, step-by-step guide based on the latest official sources:

1. When to Renew
You can apply for renewal up to 6 months (180 days) before your Emirates ID expires.
After expiry, you have a 30-day grace period to renew. Fines of AED 20 per day apply after this period, up to a maximum of AED 1,000 3.
2. Prepare the Required Documents

The documents you need depend on your status (UAE citizen, GCC national, or expatriate resident). Generally, you will need:

Your current Emirates ID card
Valid passport
Valid UAE residence visa (for expatriates)
Passport-sized photo (recent, with white background)
Birth certificate (for children under 15)
Additional documents may be required for certain categories (e.g., divorcees, widows, or people with disabilities) 5.
3. Submit Your Application

You can apply for renewal through any of the following channels:

The ICP (Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Ports Security) website: 4
The ICP mobile app (available on Google Play, App Store, and Huawei)
Accredited typing centers across the UAE 3.
4. Pay the Fees
The renewal fee varies depending on the validity period and your status.
Typical fees: AED 270 for a standard application (additional charges may apply for urgent service or typing center use).
Late renewal fines: AED 20 per day after the 30-day grace period 2.
5. Biometric Verification (if required)
Applicants above 15 years old may need to visit an ICP Customer Happiness Centre for fingerprinting and a new photo.
If you are renewing online and your biometrics are already on file, this step may not be necessary 3.
6. Track Your Application
After submitting your application, you will receive an SMS or email with your application status.
You can also track your Emirates ID renewal status online via the ICP website or app.
7. Collect Your New Emirates ID
Once your new Emirates ID is ready, you will receive an SMS notification.
You can collect your card from the designated Emirates Post office or opt for home delivery (if available) 3.
Additional Tips
If you are outside the UAE, Emiratis can now renew their Emirates ID online without returning to the country 2.
Always ensure your UAE residence visa is valid before renewing your Emirates ID (for expatriates).
For urgent renewals, you can pay an extra fee to receive your card within 24 hours at select ICP centers.
