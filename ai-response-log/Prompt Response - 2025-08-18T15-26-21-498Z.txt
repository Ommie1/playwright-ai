Mexican passport holders are eligible for a 180-day multiple-entry visa.
Indian nationals with a valid US visa or Green Card can get a 14-day visa on arrival (fee applies).

Special Note: Holders of non-standard passports or travel documents may have different requirements. Always check before travel.
GCC Residents: As of April 29, 2016, GCC residence permit holders must apply for a UAE visa before arrival.
Random Screening: Immigration authorities may conduct random visual screening and may require a hard copy of your visa or confirmation page. A fee applies if you need a printout at the airport.
